# get-value [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/get-value.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/get-value)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/get-value.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/get-value) 

> Use property paths (`a.b.c`) get a nested value from an object.

[**Benchmarks**](benchmark)

This is 10x faster and more performant than [dot-prop](https://github.com/sindresorhus/dot-prop), and it passes all of the dot-prop tests. 

Of the libs benchmarked, _dot-prop was the least performant_:

```bash
#1: deep
  get-value x 3,308,335 ops/sec ±1.32% (94 runs sampled)
  dot-prop x 197,631 ops/sec ±1.27% (94 runs sampled)
  getobject x 218,635 ops/sec ±1.51% (91 runs sampled)

#2: shallow
  get-value x 5,762,976 ops/sec ±1.21% (95 runs sampled)
  dot-prop x 695,892 ops/sec ±1.42% (95 runs sampled)
  getobject x 724,493 ops/sec ±1.46% (93 runs sampled)
```

Also, get-value supports escaping dots in paths, which is common when object keys are file paths with extensions, dot-prop does not.


## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i get-value --save
```
### Install with [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)

```bash
bower install get-value --save
```


## Usage

```js
var get = require('get-value');

var obj = {a: {b : {c: {d: 'foo'}}}};
get(obj, 'a.b.c');
//=> {d: 'foo'}

get(obj, 'a.b.c.d');
//=> 'foo'
```

* [has-value](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/has-value): Returns true if a value exists, false if empty. Works for booleans, functions, numbers, strings, nulls, objects and arrays. Other libs do this, but I needed one that would optionally _not_ treat zero as empty. Also, this works with booleans and other valu
* [set-value](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/set-value): Create nested values and any intermediaries dot notation (`'a.b.c'`) paths.
